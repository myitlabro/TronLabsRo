**Before 26th of June 2018**

Our estimated expenditure budget before 26th June was 300 USD, which included minor hardware expenses for the testable node.

**After Tron Mainet launch**

After 26th of June weâ€™ve spent 4000 USD to purchase the physical servers (HP Proliant) and to collocate them with a new provider.

**TronSR Fee**

In addition to the above, there was an additional expense of 500 USD for the 9999 TRX paid as fee in order to apply as Tron SR. I bought them when TRX was 5 cent.

Total cost when we launched as a SR Candidate in July 2018 was: 4800 USD
