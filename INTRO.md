TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet. The TronLabs Romania community is all in! This will be our contribution to the TRON ecosystem.

Since everything is new and there are lotâ€™s of things that need to be done, we will focus and build gradually in small steps. We intend to cover several topics, both technical (how to do certain things) and theoretical (how it works). We will have a FAQ section, Wiki, Guides and also a Git Repository once the site is ready.

The community is open to everyone who wants to join. Feel Free to visit our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TronLabsRo/), our Telegram Channel (https://t.me/TronLabsRo), our Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/tronlabsro/), or the Reddit subreddit (currently hidden as it's empty).
