TronLabs Romania is planning to support the TRON community in 2018 and 2019 by donating 75% of the total rewards as follows:
- 60% directly to our voters
- 10% to be used for a DApp development fund
- 2.5% for initiatives that come in need for the TRON project and community such as organizing live streams and meetups, developing useful tools for the project and other contributions regarding TRON.
- 2.5% for organizing our community events.

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRON price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.

- 25% will be retained and we will use it to cover the operating expenses and future expansion of the Tron network that is under control. We plan to expand the Data Center and increase it's capacity gradually afterwards.

Starting from 2020
Furthermore, we plan to establish a local data center in 2020 where we host our own servers, that serve the TRON network.
