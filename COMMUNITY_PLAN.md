TronLabs Romania is planning to support the TRON community in 2018 and 2019 by donating 75% of the total rewards as follows:
- 60% directly to our voters
- 10% to be used for a DApp development fund
- 2.5% for initiatives that contribute to the TRON project and community.
- 2.5% for organizing our community events.

We plan to revise the percentages periodically based on TRON (#TRX) price. Transparency about any changes is mandatory and we will plan to announce this early enough. The woting rewards will be paid as soon as we can claim the first 1000 TRX. Untill now they remain in tronscan and you can check on Trxplorer (https://www.trxplorer.io/address/TYTYuSyiEpxNsjakQSRmjiZAymvxoBbziH#/aw) that no withdrawals have ever occured.

In order to be transparent we'll spread it over separate accounts:

- **Tron DAPP Development fund** - TXgbWCjqoM7QKSntXW9t1d9eoA3j9JUhCG
- **Tron Initiatives fund** - TVT2WEFwWeaoAe1qgLM5QMyegeQ8LpPDer
- **Tron community events fund** - TELrNhTjKJxb14f9SFGKYZycJAbgB29Lts

In the long term (from 2021):
We plan to establish a local data center in 2020 where we host our own servers, that serve the TRON network.

Well 75% will be donated, but what about the rest ?
- 25% of all revenues will be retained and we will use it to cover the operating expenses and future expansion of the Tron network that is under control. We plan to expand and increase our capacity gradually afterwards.
