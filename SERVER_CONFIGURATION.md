We have both VMâ€™s and bare metal machines.

We will start with a main and a backup node, both virtualized. The bare metal servers hosting these virtual servers are currently collocated in a Tier 3 Green Data Center.

Physical servers.
A computing cluster of two nodes, each a HP Proliant with 24 Cores Xeon, 272 GB RAM, 2 TB (HDD + SSD).

Virtualized servers
For the main and backup node, our servers have the following configuration:
24 vCPU, 128 GB of RAM, 512 GB SSD, 1 gbps network connectivity.

Planned hardware expansion for Q4 2018
Deployment of the second computing cluster till end of the year. We have the current equipment ready for Data Center delivery and monitor the usage closely. 

We also plan to continuously invest into additional hardware expansion, once we are elected.
